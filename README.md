This program is the Java representation of a finite state machine, it checks whether a given String is valid, based upon specific criteria.

The criteria for this state machine, is that the characters can only be '0' or '1', and the string contains two pairs of adjacent 0's separated by an even number of characters.

As you can tell by the amount of comments, this is for a my Computer Science degree. But I put it here in case anyone would find it useful!
